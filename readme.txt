The package contains two python scripts that each reads some raw data and output a clean, human-readable data table that our project needs. 

DataProcessing.py: reads the raw data of gazes and puzzles and output files result.csv and accuracy.csv

DataFormatting.py: reads from condition orders, trial global data file and subject demography data file, and output a summary.
